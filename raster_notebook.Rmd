This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

In this tutorial, we will use the raster and rgdal libraries..

```{r}
#install rgdal is not straight in ubuntu  
#install.packages('rgdal', type = "source", configure.args=c('--with-proj-include=/usr/local/include','--with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib'))
# load packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
# setwd("working-dir-path-here")
```

changing to working directory
```{r "setup", include=FALSE}
require("knitr")
opts_knit$set(root.dir ="/home/pune1/Documents/pranav/practice/timeseries/ecology/dataset")
```

create list of ndvi file paths
# assign path to object = cleaner code

```{r}
NDVI_HARV_path <- "NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI" 
all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(NDVI_HARV_path,full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")
```

Create a raster stack of the NDVI time series
```{r}
NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)
```

# view crs of rasters
```{r}
crs(NDVI_HARV_stack)
extent(NDVI_HARV_stack)
```

view the y resolution of our rasters
```{R}
yres(NDVI_HARV_stack)
```

view the x resolution of our rasters
```{R}
xres(NDVI_HARV_stack)
```
view a plot of all of the rasters
'nc' specifies number of columns (we will have 13 plots)
```{R}
plot(NDVI_HARV_stack, 
     zlim = c(1500, 10000), 
     nc = 4)
```


# apply scale factor to data

```{R}
NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000
```
# plot stack with scale factor applied
# apply scale factor to limits to ensure uniform plottin
```{R}
plot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
     zlim = c(.15, 1),  
     nc = 4)
```


Next we will use histograms to explore the distribution of NDVI values stored in each raster.

```{R}
# create histograms of each raster
hist(NDVI_HARV_stack, xlim = c(0, 1))
```
